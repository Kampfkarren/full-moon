## Unreleased
### Added
- Added `TokenKind` to get the kind of a token without any additional data
- Added mutation methods: `set_start_position`, `set_end_position`, `set_token_type` for `TokenReference` objects
- Added `Ast::update_positions` to update all the position structs if you mutate it
- Added `node::Node` which contains `start_position` and `end_position` methods to obtain the full range of a node
- Added `Punctuated` and `Pair`, replaced lots of uses of `Vec<_>` with `Punctuated<_>`

### Changed
- Fields of `Token` and `Position` have been made private with public accessors
- Changed signatures from `Token` to `TokenReference`, which dereference to tokens
- Changed `visit_do` to use a new `Do` struct instead of `Block`

## [0.3.0] - 2019-05-24
### Added
- Added std::fmt::Display and std::error::Error implementations for Error, AstError, and TokenizerError

## [0.2.0] - 2019-05-23

## [0.1.1] - 2019-04-05
